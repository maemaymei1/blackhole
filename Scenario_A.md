Hi, Raju.

Our records indicate that you attended the most recent session of the *CodePath iOS Course* for only 10 minutes. Unfortunately, this does not meet the attendance requirement for the session.  

As you know, attendance is important to our education model. **Students are expected to attend at least half of each session** to be marked “Present” as stated on our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19).

For future sessions, please make sure to meet the attendance requirements so that you’ll receive the credit for those sessions.

All the best,
CodePath&#46;org Team
