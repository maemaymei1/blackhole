Hi, Pia.

Thanks for reaching out. I appreciate your interest to continue with the *CodePath Cybersecurity Course*, however, as stated in our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19), the **4 absences you’ve rendered** has qualified you to be in the "Observer" role for the rest of the course.

Even as an “Observer”, you can continue with your learning as you will retain lifetime access to the course material. You may know more about the benefits of this role through this [link](MockWebage).

But I encourage you to enroll once again in this course in the coming spring semester – hopefully, you’ll have a more favorable schedule by then. Make sure to watch out for the following dates:
1.	Course registration (Jan 3-6, 2022)
2.	Finalization of schedules (Jan 7, 2022)
3.	Start of courses (Jan 10, 2022)

I really hope that our team at CodePath&#46;org can continue to provide you with all the assistance you need as you work your way through your career in Cybersecurity. And I look forward to hearing from you in the next months.


All the best,

CodePath&#46;org Team
