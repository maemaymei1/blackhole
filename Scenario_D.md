Hi, Dennis.

Thanks for letting us know of your plans. I’ve noted your request to continue with the *CodePath Android Course* as an Observer and have reflected it in our records. 

As an “Observer” of the course, you have **lifetime access to the course material, which you can study it at your own pace**. Submission of **coursework is up to you** – you may send them in at your convenience. This way, you can continue with your learning while doing your internship.

We hope to keep you looped in so I highly encourage you to join our [mailing list]( https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) to receive updates on upcoming courses and events.

Should there be other inquiries, do reach out to us here at CodePath&#46;org.

Congratulations and good luck on your internship!

All the best,

CodePath&#46;org Team
