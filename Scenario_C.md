Hi, Farhan.

Thanks for reaching out to us. I hope you’re feeling much better and have fully recovered. I also hope that you’ve sorted out your technical issues. 

Should you again encounter these technical issues in the future, I advise you to reach out to our **Slack Unit Help Channels** (e.g. android-unit05-spring21) to guide you through some basic troubleshooting, or you may request assistance from our Tech Support on [Discussions System]( https://discussions.codepath.com/).

Regarding your coursework, as you know, `CodePath.org` has a strict policy on submission. However, because of the unforeseeable issues that you’ve encountered, you are given another chance to submit your coursework. **Please make sure to send it in by tomorrow, 11:59pm**.

All the best,

CodePath&#46;org Team
